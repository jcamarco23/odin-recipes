        <li>2 tablespoons xanthan gum</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>

        <li>Whisk milk, egg, olive oil, and vinegar together in a separate 
            bowl until well combined, about 1 minute. Stir milk mixture in

             roll each piece on a floured surface to a 6-inch circle. Place on the prepared baking sheets;
